      <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
      <p>I have only been into web development for a short period of time.<br>
         It has included a lot of self teaching but also a lot of help and mentorship from those around me.</p> <br>
         <p>I am really excited to show my coding journey and see how much I can learn.</p>
         <p>My passions outside of coding involve anything automotive or fitness related.</p>
